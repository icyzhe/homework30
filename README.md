# CISC7401 Homework 3 
## Deep Learning for Image Recognition 
@Author: Zhe He

Overall task: Given a training set of data, you should train a “deep model” (e.g., multi-layer
perceptron, convolutional neural network, and transformer), evaluate your model on the
testing set and some open-set data w.r.t some metrics, and write up a report.

Train different deep neural networks (including MLP, ResNet, ViT transformer) on the training
set. [This website and links therein](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/transfer_learning_tutorial.html) might be important to you.
You can refer to PyTorch for [building your network](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/defining_a_neural_network.html), or using other established networks such as
ResNet and Transformer. When training the deep neural networks for classification, you can use
cross-entropy loss.
